#• Expected Output:

    Sorts an array using the Quick Sort algorithm.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list): The list of elements to be sorted.
    
    Returns:
    list: A new sorted list in descending order based on CGPA.
    
    The Quick Sort algorithm works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This implementation sorts the array in descending order based on CGPA.
    
    Time Complexity:
    - Average and Worst Case: O(n^2) (when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot)
    - Best Case: O(n log n) (when the pivot divides the array into two equal halves)
    
    Space Complexity:
    - O(log n) on average for recursive stack space, O(n) in the worst case.

    The Merge Sort algorithm works by dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half recursively, and then merging the sorted halves back together. This implementation sorts the array in descending order based on CGPA.
    
    Time Complexity:
    - O(n log n) for all cases (best, average, and worst) due to the divide-and-conquer approach.

#This code provides a mapping of operations to recommended algorithms along with justifications for their use in an inventory management system.
#  It includes implementations of binary search, hash table search, and merge sort for sorting the inventory by price or quantity.
#  The example usage demonstrates how to search for a product and sort the inventory based on different attributes.
#  The debugging statements in the binary search process help trace the search operation and confirm that the target product is found successfully.
#Overall, this code serves as a practical application of sorting and searching algorithms in a real-world scenario, showcasing the importance of algorithm selection based on dataset characteristics and performance requirements.
#Note: The binary search function assumes that the inventory list is sorted by product ID.
#  In a real application, you would need to ensure that the data is sorted before performing a binary search or use a hash table for more efficient lookups without sorting.
#  Additionally, the merge sort function can be used to sort the inventory by any attribute by specifying the appropriate key index.
#This concludes the implementation of the inventory management system with efficient search and sort algorithms, along with AI-generated explanations and justifications for the chosen algorithms.

#This code simulates stock price data, calculates percentage changes, and implements Heap Sort to rank stocks by their daily gain/loss.
# I have also used a hash map for efficient searching of stock symbols and compared the performance of the custom Heap Sort with Python's built-in sorted() function.
# The output displays the top 5 stocks by percentage change for both sorting methods and the search result for a specific stock symbol, demonstrating the efficiency of the implemented algorithms in a real-time stock data analysis scenario.
# Overall, I believe this lab exercise provides a comprehensive understanding of sorting and searching algorithms, their implementation, and their application in real-world scenarios, with the assistance of AI-generated explanations and optimizations.
# I encourage students to further explore the trade-offs between different algorithms and their suitability for various types of data and performance requirements, enhancing their problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
# This concludes the lab on Algorithms with AI Assistance, covering sorting, searching, and algorithm optimization using AI tools in the context of student records and stock data analysis.
# I recommend students experiment with different datasets, algorithm variations, and performance metrics to deepen their understanding and proficiency in algorithm design and analysis.
